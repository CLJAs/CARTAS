\begin{abstract}
	\noindent
	Contact letter and exchange of opinions with the account Kurt Bizarre (Samuel). He asks me to define DI and TPI and also to indicate the errors in the demonstrations of the Theorems: \\
	$|A| < |P(A)|$ \\
	$|P(N)| = |R|$ \\
	The second one does not pose any problems since if all infinite cardinals are equal, it is compatible with my statement. And I myself proved it to myself by applying LJA Constructions and the Naive Theorem CA (patience, it's not the time for that today) \\
	
	\noindent
	Expected delivery date is April 18, 2023, as always, I think it will be two pages... and it will be done soon...\\
	
	\noindent
	If you are wondering why this has an abstract, it's because I have a Latex skeleton that I don't know how to change hahahaha, and in English by ChatGPT because I have an American friend to whom I'm going to pass it on, who has been asking me for translated material for a while.
